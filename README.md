# Drone Lab Assignment

This repository contains three markdown files:

- `Task1.md`
- `Task2.md`
- `Task3.md`

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Drone Simulation in Gazebo
This task involves simulating a drone in the Gazebo environment.

### Task 2: Object Detection (Breast Cancer Tumor Detection)
This task focuses on object detection, specifically detecting tumors in cases of breast cancer.

### Task 3: Open-Ended Task
If you're unable to complete the previous two tasks, yet you feel we should hire you- explain here why should we hire you?
We would anyway prefer people who did the above tasks, this is for getting that one enthusiastist person who'd have to pass the interview round.

[You're supposed to do only one of the 3 tasks. Check the task files for more info.](#)

## Resources

Each file contains resources to help you complete the tasks. You should be able to work through the tasks using them.
